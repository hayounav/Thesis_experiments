	assertion violations	+
	acceptance   cycles 	- (not selected)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by -E flag)

State-vector 80 byte, depth reached 1614, errors: 0
    89677 states, stored
     1870 states, matched
    91547 transitions (= stored+matched)
     4342 atomic steps
hash conflicts:         3 (resolved)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    9.236	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    4.319	actual memory usage for states (compression: 46.76%)
         	state-vector as stored = 23 byte + 28 byte overhead
  128.000	memory used for hash table (-w24)
    0.534	memory used for DFS stack (-m10000)
  132.831	total actual memory usage
